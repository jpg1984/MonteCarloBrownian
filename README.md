# MonteCarloBrownian

In this computational lab we model Brownian motion of pollen grains suspended in water. The simulation
performed used a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling method with a random walk in the velocity variable.
Two models were simulated, the first of which produces incorrect results and leads to an unphysical increase of
the mean squared velocity with the number of collisions experienced by the Brownian particle. In the second
model this increase is corrected for by adding an approximation for the viscosity of the water is added to
the model, thus producing a correct result for the mean square velocities and displacements for the Brownian
particle
